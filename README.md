# Programming-with-mooc.fi
This repository contains my code from the following courses: 

    a) Object Oriented Programming with Java Part 1 - Univeristy of Helsinki
    b) Object Oriented Programming with Java Part 2 - Univeristy of Helsinki
    c) Aalto C Programming - Aalto University
    d) Cyber Security Base with F-Secure - Univeristy of Helsinki and F-Secure Cyber Secuirty Accademy

Each lab within the courses are formatted as Netbeans projects and except for the
last few excersizes in the C course and Cyber Security course (I'm currently completing them), everything passes 
the unit tests created by the universities.
