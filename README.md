#Programming-with-mooc.fi
This repository contains my code from the following courses: 
    a) Object Oriented Programming with Java Part 1 - Univeristy of Helsinki
    b) Object Oriented Programming with Java Part 2 - Univeristy of Helsinki
    c) Aalto C Programming - Aalto University

Each lab within the courses are formatted as Netbeans projects and besides for the
last few excersizes in the C course (I'm currently completing it), everything passes 
the unit tests created by the universities.
